# hello-world
following the simple hello world tutorial, so people know that I know how to use github features.

## About myself:
I'm Kevin. I'm interested in getting better at various technologies and learning what it is I need 
to know while pursuing careers. I've been coding since early high-school days with BASIC and went 
through Java programming courses. Eventually I worked with some nice folks at two different 
businesses and learned a lot. I always feel like I don't know enough, which is a blessing and a
curse; knowing that you don't know something allows you to accept that there's something to strive
to learn, but it can also be discouraging to feel as if you're learning too slowly or not grasping
a concept at a pace you think is appropriate.

I went to IIT and received a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Cybersecurity Engineering (a specialization 
within Computer Engineering to focus on Cybersecurity topics). While I know the basics, I'm interested in 
learning the operating procedures and applications of secure technologies within a field. While I know a 
sizable portion about hardware design for a simple MIPS processor and microcomputers and their organization,
I don't have job experience building or supporting the firmware for such systems.

My Goals with my GitHub account are as follows:
1. Create simple projects that express my learning process for certain technologies.
2. Compose a worthwhile project that interfaces with a hardware device (still not certain); this might be related
to tooling around with bluetooth devices in an attempt to reduce latency.
3. Find what types of projects and working environments spark the most joy and fulfillment.
4. Figure out if my spelling without spellcheck is good enough (typing readme lmao)
